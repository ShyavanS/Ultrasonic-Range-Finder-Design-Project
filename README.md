# Ultrasonic Range Finder Design Project

Final design project for an Engineering Physics course at McMaster University. An ultrasonic range finder designed using several ICs and a pair of piezoelectric transducers that displays the recorded distance to an object in centimeters on 2 7-segment display modules.

This project was made for the ENGPHYS 3BA3 course which focused on circuits with non-linear and active components. To demonstrate the knowledge learned from the course, the final project was to built an ultrasonic range finder which in this case was accomplished with op-amps, a comparator, 555 timers, a monostable multivibrator, an SR latch, BCD counters, BCD to 7SD decoders, and 7SD modules for the output. The report documenting how it works in full is available for reading & the circuit design was drafted on Multisim.

The sensor was required to be accurate to within 1 cm for distances between 10 and 99 cm, however the design that was developed prove to provide accurate readings between 1 and 175 cm.
